This UI theme use a custom compiler build on Gulp and JS. If you want to edit the UI you must first install the compiler:

```
$ npm install
```
then run compiler and watcher by run:

```
$ gulp
```
You can now edit the source files under `/.src` folder that will be compiled inside the root folder (don't edit compiled files.)
